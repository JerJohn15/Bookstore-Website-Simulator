# Bookstore-Website-Simulator


#Project Summary: 

This project was a college project for my Database Management class. The goal was to identify a real-world application where we would utilize a database and implement it using whatever languages we felt would get the job done.  Because of my lack of experience with web design and a GUI, I decided to create a text-based website simulator for an online bookstore website in Java using JDBC and MySQL to handle the acessing and manipulation of the database. In addition to coding the project, we needed provide documentation that explains our application functionalities, defines our targeted users, and include an ER Diagram, to model the domain of our application.

#Whats Contained in the Document:

In my document I explain, why I chose to create a simulation of an e-commerce bookstore website, identify the targeted design features I wanted to implement,  outline the design of each of the classes, tables and SQL queries used in my database, and how I access the database in the backend. In addition, I've also included an ER-Diagram, which details the relationships each of my tables have in the database, and a screen shot of a sample test run of the program. Finally, I offer a conclusion, explaining some of the challenges I faced while working on it. 




**Note: ** I've created some SQL files containing sample data for my database using MySQL. You will need to import them using MySQL Workbench.
