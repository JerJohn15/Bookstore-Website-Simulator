# Bookstore-Website-Simulator
A console simulator for an e commerce website. 

This project was a college project for my Database Management class. The goal was to identify a real-world application where we would utilize a database and implement it. We were open to use whatever type of languages we felt would be necessary to complete the project. Because of my lack of experience with web design and a GUI, I decided to create a text-based website simulator for an online bookstore website. Please refer to the documentation located [here ](https://drive.google.com/a/bu.edu/file/d/0B_Mzb0tpEYLWWHdMaTlrOEI0bms/view?usp=sharing) for a detailed explanation of my design. 

**Note: ** In order for this project to work you will need to: download and import the SQL files (located in the link) to MySQL (or whatever database of your choosing).
