# Bookstore-Website-Simulator




This project was a college project for my Database Management class. The goal was to identify a real-world application where we would utilize a database and implement it using whatever languages we felt would get the job done.  Because of my lack of experience with web design and a GUI, I decided to create a text-based website simulator for an online bookstore website. In addition to coding the project, we needed provide documentation that explains our application functionalities, defines our targeted users, and include an ER Diagram, to model the domain of our application. Go  [here ](https://drive.google.com/a/bu.edu/file/d/0B_Mzb0tpEYLWWHdMaTlrOEI0bms/view?usp=sharing) to view the documentation. 

**Note: ** I've created some SQL files containing sample data for my database using MySQL. You will need to import them using MySQL Workbench.
